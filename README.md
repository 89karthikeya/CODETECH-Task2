Overview of the project: Overview of the Mobile App Wireframe Project

For this project, I’m designing wireframes for a To-Do List App to showcase its layout, functionality, and user interaction. The goal is to create a user-friendly structure and navigation that effectively communicates the app's purpose.

Concept and Purpose:

The app is designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently by creating to-do lists, setting reminders, and tracking progress.
Navigation Flow:

I’ve outlined the navigation flow to show how users will move between different screens, which includes:
Home Screen → Add Task Screen
Home Screen → Task Details Screen
Home Screen → Settings Screen
Screen Layouts:

The wireframes will include the following main screens with basic layouts:
Home Screen: A list of tasks with checkboxes, task names, due dates, and an “Add Task” button.
Add Task Screen: Input fields for task details, such as name, description, due date, and priority, with “Save” and “Cancel” buttons.
Task Details Screen: Detailed task information, including options to edit or delete the task.
Settings Screen: Options for customizing app preferences and notifications.
UI Elements:

The wireframes will use basic UI components like buttons, input fields, checkboxes, icons, and labels. Examples include:
Buttons: Rounded corners with subtle shadows to add a 3D effect.
Input Fields: Clearly labeled with placeholder text for task entry.
Navigation Bar: Positioned at the top of each screen for easy access.
Design Tool:

Figma will be used to create the wireframes. This tool allows for easy creation of custom frames, simple UI elements, and clear screen layouts.
The focus will be on clear, organized designs with ample whitespace to enhance readability and usability.
